# Attempt at CodeMirror + in-place MathJax

Experimenting to replace $math$ with formulas in CodeMirror.
Buggy and work-in-progress...

**Demo**: http://cben.github.io/CodeMirror-MathJax/demo.html

(I'm directly working in `gh-pages` branch without a `master` branch, as that's the simplest thing that could possibly work; http://oli.jp/2011/github-pages-workflow/ lists several alternatives.)
